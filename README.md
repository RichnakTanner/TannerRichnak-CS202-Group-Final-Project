Contributions made to CS 202 Group 17 Final Project by Tanner Richnak

This section of the program is responsible for reading in data from a vector of inputted .wav files, as well as writing data to a new .wav file.  The code is designed to accept 8 bit mono, 8 bit stereo, 16 bit mono, and 16 bit stereo .wav files.

Other parts of the program include audio processing, and user interface.  These portions were completed by other students in Group 17.
